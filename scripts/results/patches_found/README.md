# Description
The patches are organized as follow:

```
<Approach Name>/<Project>/<Bug id>/<Seed>/
```

The patches have file names:

```
patch_<ID>.diff
```

Additionally, I am modifying the tools in order to put in the patch name the time it takes to generate it:

```
patch_<time in miliseconds>_<ID>.diff
```
